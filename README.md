# mescaline
Pre-privilege ESCALation enuMeration framework.

# Notes
This is a tool I wrote in the Offensive Security PWK lab. I need to give it a clean re-write. I'm not sure it's currently usable.

It's main purpose is to deploy an enumeration script, and parse it's output. It also automates banner research by wrapping searchsploit and surfraw.
