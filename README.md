Pre-privilege ESCALation enuMeration framework.

# Notes
This is one of my favorite tools i wrote to help automate certain attacks in the Offensive Security PWK lab.

I need to give it a clean re-write. I'm not sure it's currently usable.

There was a firewalling appliance separating two networks, and i couldn't reverse tunnel through it. So i kept having to
copy and paste my enumeration log from one terminal into another. If you use the firewall bypass option you'll see what i
did to automate the transfer.

A findsock shell would have been a better solution ;)
