Pre-privilege ESCALation enuMeration framework.

# Notes
This is one tool I wrote to help automate things in the Offensive Security PWK lab.

I need to give it a clean re-write. I'm not sure it's currently usable.

There was a firewalling appliance separating two networks, and i couldn't reverse tunnel back through it. So i kept having to
copy and paste my enumeration log from one terminal into another.

It's main purpose is to deploy an enumeration script, and parse it's output. It also automate's banner research by wrapping searchsploit and surfraw.

A findsock shell would probably have been a better solution ;)
