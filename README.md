Pre-privilege ESCALation enuMeration framework.

# Notes
This is one tool I wrote to help automate things in the Offensive Security PWK lab.

I need to give it a clean re-write. I'm not sure it's currently usable.

There was a firewalling appliance separating two networks, and i couldn't reverse tunnel back through it. So i kept having to
copy and paste my enumeration log from one terminal into another.

A findsock shell would probably have been a better solution ;)
